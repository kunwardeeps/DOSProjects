## Description
For this project, we utilised Phoenix framework to create a web application that would provide a simulation of
the ongoing bitcoin mining and transactions. To provide the simulation results we made use of Phoenix's MVC
architecture to design layouts, web pages and the controllers necessary to communicate with the back-end and
relay the information back to the front-end. 

The web application covered two important aspects:
1. Displaying on-going simulations by means of a chart & dashboard
2. An interface for transacting bitcoins
